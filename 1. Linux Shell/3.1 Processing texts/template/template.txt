If water were kisses, I'd send you the sea
If leaves were hugs, I'd send you a tree
If nite was love ,I'd send you the stars
But I can't send you my heart cause that where you are.

I hoped that he would love me,
And he has kissed my mouth,
But I am like a stricken bird
That cannot reach the south.
For though I know he loves me,
To-night my heart is sad;
His kiss was not so wonderful
As all the dreams I had.
